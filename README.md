The [FreeBSD Portstree](https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports) is a collection of build recipes
and metadata for more than 46k 3rd party projects and the source for binary packages on
FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD and derivatives.

This is an attempt to populate all ports with CPE data. The lists are automatically
updated once a week. If you are a FreeBSD Ports committer or Ports maintainer this is a
chance for you to help!
